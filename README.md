## Hi, I’m Tatiana 👋

I’m a **Full-stack developer** with 2 years of coding experience, with a systems and quality mindset. Сloud- and AI- enthusiastic.
I work with **Go, JavaScript (React/Node.js), REST APIs, WebSockets, PostgreSQL/SQLite, and Docker**, and focused on building **clean, reliable, and observable systems**.

Over the past years, I’ve built and launched several end-to-end web applications at *Kood/Sisu coding school*, 
working across backend, frontend, infrastructure, and testing. 
I focus on predictable system behavior across environments, including backend logic, state persistence, containerized deployment, and log-based debugging.

I’ve contributed to ~20 peer projects through code reviews, debugging, and often helping teams spot gaps early and improve system clarity.

## 🔧 What I focus on

- **Cloud & DevOps foundations**  
  Dockerized services, Linux/WSL environments, CI/CD basics, and cloud-native thinking  
  (AWS Cloud Practitioner certified)

- **Backend & API design**  
  Go and Node.js services, REST APIs, authentication, data modelling, and clear contracts

- **System reliability & testing mindset**  
  Cross-environment testing, edge cases, log-based debugging, and failure analysis

- **Real-time and stateful systems**  
  WebSockets, real-time synchronization, persistent state, and timing-sensitive logic

- **Clarity through documentation**  
  Writing readable docs, architectural notes, and explanations that keep teams aligned

## 🧠 Background & collaboration

Before transitioning fully into software engineering, I worked in **PR and communications in fintech (Sberbank, 100M+ users)** and in UX-oriented projects.  
This background shaped how I approach engineering: I care about **reliability, security, user impact, and clear communication**.
