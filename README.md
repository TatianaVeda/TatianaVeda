## Hi, I’m Tatiana, you can also call me Tanja 👋

**Full-stack developer** with 2 years of coding experience, with a systems and quality mindset. Сloud- and AI- enthusiastic.
I work with **Go, JavaScript (React/Node.js), REST APIs, WebSockets, PostgreSQL/SQLite, and Docker**, and focused on building **clean, reliable, and observable systems**.

Over the past years, I’ve built and launched several end-to-end web applications at [**Kood/Sisu coding school**](https://koodsisu.fi/), 
working across backend, frontend, infrastructure, and testing. 
I focus on predictable system behavior across environments, including backend logic, state persistence, containerized deployment, and log-based debugging.
I’ve contributed to ~20 peer projects through code reviews, debugging, and often helping teams spot gaps early and improve system clarity.
**AWS Cloud Practitioner certified**

### 🧠 Background & collaboration
Before transitioning fully into software engineering, I worked in **PR and communications in fintech (Sberbank, 100M+ users)** and in UX-oriented projects.  
This background shaped how I approach engineering: I care about **reliability, security, user impact, and clear communication**.
